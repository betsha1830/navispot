# Feature F3.2 Dashboard UI Revamp Plan

**Date:** January 6, 2026
**Status:** ✅ Completed with UI Improvements
**Implementation Date:** January 11, 2026
**UI Improvements Date:** January 15, 2026
**Previous Implementation:** Grid-based card layout (feature-F3-2-dashboard.md)

---

## Overview

Revamp the dashboard UI from a grid-based card layout to a table-based layout with advanced filtering, sorting, and search capabilities. This revamp improves playlist management for bulk export operations while maintaining visual consistency with the login page design language.

✅ **COMPLETED:** The Dashboard component has been updated to use the table-based layout with all features implemented.

---

## UI Flow Stages

The dashboard export workflow is divided into three stages with a consistent layout:

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Before Exporting** | Browse, filter, search, and select playlists in a data table |
| **During Exporting** | Track export progress with real-time status updates - layout remains the same |
| **After Exporting** | View export results, statistics, and options to export again or return to dashboard |

**Note:** The dashboard layout (50% top two-column section + 50% bottom table) remains consistent across all three stages. The only differences between stages are dynamic UI elements (progress bars, status badges, export button state).

---

## Stage 1: Before Exporting (Table View)

### 1.1 Table Layout Requirements ✅ Completed

#### Container Properties
- **Height:** Responsive to viewport (`max-h-[70vh]` or `h-[calc(100vh-250px)]`)
- **Width:** Full width appropriate for data display (not constrained like login card)
- **Overflow:** Inner scrollable content with sticky header
- **Pagination:** None - all playlists loaded at once for simplicity
- **Loved Songs Row:** Second row (after header) - visible at beginning of table, scrolls with content

#### Header Row Behavior ✅ Completed
- **Sticky positioning:** Header row sticks to top when scrolling
- **Background:** Semi-transparent backdrop with blur effect
- **Z-index:** Higher than table body content

#### Column Structure ✅ Completed

| Column | Width | Content | Sortable | Filterable |
|--------|-------|---------|----------|------------|
| Select | 60px | Checkbox for individual + "Select All" header checkbox | No | No |
| Cover | 80px | Playlist cover image (Next.js Image) | No | No |
| Name | Auto | Playlist name (truncated with tooltip) | Yes | Yes |
| Tracks | 120px | Total track count | Yes | No |
| Owner | 200px | Owner display name | Yes | Yes |
| Status | 120px | Export status badge | No | **No** (non-filterable) |

**Table Row Order:**
1. **Header Row** (sticky) - Column titles with sort indicators
2. **Loved Songs Row** - Liked Songs playlist as the first playlist row
3. **Playlist Rows** - Remaining playlists scrollable within table body

**Note:** The Status column is explicitly non-filterable to maintain focus on selection and export actions.

### 1.2 Functional Requirements ✅ Completed

#### Sorting ✅ Completed
- Click column headers to toggle ascending/descending sort
- Visual indicator (arrow icon) showing sort direction
- Default sort: Name (A-Z)
- Sortable columns: Name, Tracks, Owner

#### Filtering ✅ Completed
- Filter dropdown per applicable column (Name, Owner)
- Quick filter chips above table for common filters
- Filters act on the full playlist list (no pagination)
- Filter options:
  - All Playlists
  - Selected Only
  - Not Selected
  - Liked Songs
  - Exported
  - Not Exported

#### Searching ✅ Completed
- Global search bar above table
- Searches across: Playlist name, Owner name
- Debounced search (300ms delay)
- Clear search button with icon

#### Selection ✅ Completed
- Individual row checkbox selection
- Header checkbox for "Select All" (selects filtered/visible playlists only)
- "Select All" selects only playlists matching current filters and search criteria
- Selection state persists during session
- Visual indicator for selected rows (row highlight)
- **Real-time Selected Playlists Table:** Selected playlists immediately appear in the Selected Playlists table (top-left) when user selects them in the main table (bottom)

#### Export Button (Fixed Footer) ✅ Completed
- Position: Fixed at bottom-right of screen (like cookie banner)
- Button text changes based on state:
  - **Before Export:** "Export Selected (n)"
  - **During Export:** "Cancel Export"
- Disabled when no playlists are selected (before export)
- Disabled during active export (button becomes Cancel)

**Confirmation Popup (Before Export):** ✅ Completed
When clicking "Export Selected", a confirmation dialog appears:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Export Playlists                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Are you sure you want to export    │
│  the following 3 playlists?         │
│                                     │
│  • Liked Songs (150 tracks)         │
│  • Playlist A (42 tracks)           │
│  • Playlist B (89 tracks)           │
│                                     │
│           [Cancel]  [Export]        │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Fixed Export Button Styling:** ✅ Completed
```tsx
<div className="fixed bottom-6 right-6 z-50">
  <button
    onClick={isExporting ? onCancel : onShowConfirmation}
    disabled={!isExporting && selectedIds.size === 0}
    className="rounded-lg px-6 py-3 text-sm font-medium shadow-lg transition-all hover:shadow-xl disabled:cursor-not-allowed disabled:opacity-50 disabled:hover:shadow-lg
      {isExporting 
        ? 'bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600 text-white'
        : 'bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600 text-white'}"
  >
    {isExporting ? 'Cancel Export' : `Export Selected (${selectedIds.size})`}
  </button>
</div>
```

**Behavior:** ✅ Completed
- Visible on all views (Before/During/After Export)
- Text changes from "Export Selected" to "Cancel Export" during export
- Color changes from blue (export) to red (cancel) during export
- Shows confirmation popup before starting export
- Disabled when no selection (before export)
- Button remains active for cancellation during export

### 1.3 Visual Design (Login Page Theme) ✅ Updated

The table inherits visual style elements from the login page but not its layout/sizing constraints.

#### Statistics Display ✅ Updated (January 12, 2026)

Statistics are now displayed as inline badges in the Selected Playlists panel header:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Selected Playlists (3)           [150] [142✓] [8✗]                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Name                    │ Status      │ Progress                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
```

## Export Progress Display ✅ Completed

### Overview ✅ Completed

Export progress is displayed inline within the Selected Playlists panel during export, not as a separate component. Progress bars and status updates appear in each playlist row of the Selected Playlists table.

### Selected Playlists Panel with Progress ✅ Completed

The Selected Playlists panel displays per-playlist progress during export:

```typescript
interface SelectedPlaylistItem {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'exporting' | 'exported' | 'failed';
  progress: {
    current: number;
    total: number;
    percent: number;
  };
  matchedCount: number;
  unmatchedCount: number;
}

// Panel shows per-playlist progress bars and inline statistics
```

### Progress Bar Display ✅ Completed

```tsx
{/* Progress Bar in Selected Playlists Table Row */}
<div className="w-full">
  <div className="flex items-center justify-between mb-1">
    <span className="text-xs text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400">
      {progress.current}/{progress.total} tracks
    </span>
    <span className="text-xs font-medium text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-300">
      {progress.percent}%
    </span>
  </div>
  <div className="h-2 bg-zinc-100 dark:bg-zinc-800 rounded-full overflow-hidden">
    <div 
      className="h-full bg-green-500 transition-all duration-300"
      style={{ width: `${progress.percent}%` }}
    />
  </div>
</div>
```

### Layout Configuration ✅ Completed

The dashboard uses a consistent 50/50 vertical split layout across all stages (before/during/after export):

```tsx
{/* Top Section - 50% height */}
<div className="h-[50%] flex gap-4 overflow-hidden">
  {/* Left Column - Selected Playlists (50% width) */}
  <div className="w-1/2 flex flex-col">
    <SelectedPlaylistsPanel {...props} />
  </div>
  
  {/* Right Column - Unmatched Songs (50% width) */}
  <div className="w-1/2 flex flex-col">
    <UnmatchedSongsPanel {...props} />
  </div>
</div>

{/* Bottom Section - 50% height */}
<div className="h-[50%] overflow-hidden">
  <PlaylistTable {...props} disabled={isExporting} />
</div>
```

**Notes:**
- Layout remains consistent across all export stages
- Height percentages are configurable via CSS or props
- All panels remain scrollable independently
- Table header remains sticky in all stages
- Table interactions are disabled during export (selection, sort, filter)
- Progress bars appear in Selected Playlists panel during export
- Statistics update in real-time during export

## Export Tracking & Sync Mechanism ✅ Completed

### Overview ✅ Completed

Export status is tracked using Navidrome's `comment` field on playlists. This enables cross-device sync and change detection.

### Comment Metadata Format ✅ Completed

When a playlist is exported, store JSON metadata in Navidrome's `comment` field:

```json
{
  "spotifyPlaylistId": "abc123",
  "navidromePlaylistId": "nav123",
  "spotifySnapshotId": "xyz789",
  "exportedAt": "2026-01-06T10:30:00Z",
  "trackCount": 42
}
```

### Export Status States ✅ Completed

| Status | Condition | Badge Style |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Not Exported** | No matching Navidrome playlist found | Gray `bg-zinc-100 text-zinc-600` |
| **Exported** | Navidrome playlist exists with matching `snapshotId` | Green `bg-green-100 text-green-700` |
| **Out of Sync** | Navidrome exists but `snapshotId` differs | Orange `bg-orange-100 text-orange-700` |

### Sync Detection ✅ Completed

1. **On Dashboard Load:**
   - Fetch all Navidrome playlists
   - Parse `comment` field for metadata
   - Match with Spotify playlists by `spotifyPlaylistId`
   - Compare current Spotify `snapshot_id` with stored `snapshotId`

2. **Status Determination:**
   - No match found → `not-exported`
   - Match found + `snapshotId` matches → `exported`
   - Match found + `snapshotId` differs → `out-of-sync`

3. **Sync Actions:**
   - `out-of-sync` playlists show warning icon
   - Re-export updates existing Navidrome playlist (using `navidromePlaylistId`)
   - New exports create new Navidrome playlists

### Liked Songs Tracking ✅ Completed

Liked Songs sync uses a special approach:

- **First Export:** Create Navidrome playlist named "Liked Songs" with metadata in comment
- **Subsequent Exports:** Compare saved tracks count with stored `trackCount`
- **Out of Sync:** Show status when count differs from stored value
- **Fallback:** If no matching playlist found, treat as not exported

### Data Model Updates ✅ Completed

#### PlaylistTableItem (Updated)

```typescript
interface PlaylistTableItem {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  images: { url: string }[];
  owner: { display_name: string };
  tracks: { total: number };
  snapshot_id: string;
  isLikedSongs: boolean;
  selected: boolean;
  exportStatus: 'none' | 'exported' | 'out-of-sync';
  navidromePlaylistId?: string;
  lastExportedAt?: string;
}
```

#### ExportMetadata ✅ Completed

```typescript
export interface ExportMetadata {
  spotifyPlaylistId: string;
  navidromePlaylistId?: string;
  spotifySnapshotId: string;
  exportedAt: string;
  trackCount: number;
}

  };
  selectedIds: Set<string>;
}

export type ExportStatus = 'none' | 'exported' | 'out-of-sync';

// NEW: Track Display Types for Songs Panel (Read-Only)
export interface SongItem {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  album: string;
  artist: string;
  duration: string; // mm:ss format
}

export interface SongsPanelState {
  playlistId: string | null;
  tracks: SongItem[];
  isLoading: boolean;
}

export function getExportStatusBadgeColor(status: ExportStatus): string {
  switch (status) {
    case 'exported':
      return 'bg-green-100 text-green-800 border-green-200';
    case 'out-of-sync':
      return 'bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800 border-yellow-200';
    default:
      return 'bg-gray-100 text-gray-800 border-gray-200';
  }
}

export function getExportStatusLabel(status: ExportStatus): string {
  switch (status) {
    case 'exported':
      return 'Exported';
    case 'out-of-sync':
      return 'Out of Sync';
    default:
      return 'Not Exported';
  }
}
```

## UI Improvements (January 15, 2026) ✅ Completed

### Bottom Table Height Fix (January 15, 2026) ✅ Completed

#### Fixed Viewport Overflow Issues
- **PlaylistTable Layout**: Changed to `flex flex-col h-full overflow-hidden` for proper height containment
- **Scrollable Table Container**: Replaced fixed `max-h-[calc(100vh-250px)]` with `overflow-auto h-full`
- **Search Bar Positioning**: Added `flex-shrink-0` to search bar to maintain visibility
- **Footer Positioning**: Added `flex-shrink-0` to stats footer to keep it visible at bottom
- **Layout Consistency**: Now uses flex-based layout that respects parent container's 50% height allocation

#### Benefits
- Table content properly constrains to its allocated viewport space (50% of screen)
- Table scrolls independently without affecting other dashboard sections
- Search bar and stats footer remain visible and accessible
- No more content overflow beyond viewport boundaries
- Consistent scrolling behavior across all dashboard sections

### Visual Presentation Enhancements

#### Scrollable Table Containers
- **SelectedPlaylistsPanel**: Added `flex flex-col h-full` with `overflow-auto flex-1` for proper scrolling
- **UnmatchedSongsPanel**: Added `flex flex-col h-full` with `overflow-auto flex-1` for proper scrolling
- **Sticky Headers**: Both panels now have sticky table headers that remain visible during scroll
- **Header Positioning**: Headers use `flex-shrink-0` to prevent squishing when content is scrolled

#### Spacing and Layout Improvements
- **Panel Padding**: Added consistent `p-4` padding to both left and right panels in non-exporting mode
- **Bottom Section Spacing**: Added `pt-4` padding to the bottom main table section
- **Dashboard Wrapper**: Removed unnecessary `space-y-6` wrapper spacing for tighter layout
- **Header Consistency**: All panel headers now use consistent `px-4 py-3` padding

#### Column Width Constraints and Tooltips
- **Name Column Width**: Added `max-w-[300px]` constraint to playlist name columns in PlaylistTable
- **Tooltip Support**: All truncated text now shows full content via `title` attribute on hover
- **Table Cells**: Added tooltips to:
  - PlaylistTable: Name column (both regular and liked songs rows)
  - SelectedPlaylistsPanel: Name column
  - UnmatchedSongsPanel: Title, Album, and Artist columns
  - PlaylistTable: Owner column (already had tooltip support)

#### Empty State Improvements
- **Centering**: Empty states in UnmatchedSongsPanel use `flex-1` for proper vertical centering
- **Consistent Styling**: Empty states maintain the same visual hierarchy as populated states

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Component Updates
| Component | Changes |
|-----------|---------|
| `ExportLayoutManager.tsx` | Added padding to top section panels and bottom section |
| `SelectedPlaylistsPanel.tsx` | Added scrollable container with sticky header and tooltips |
| `UnmatchedSongsPanel.tsx` | Added scrollable container with sticky header and tooltips |
| `PlaylistTable.tsx` | Added max-width constraints and tooltip support to name columns |
| `Dashboard.tsx` | Removed unnecessary wrapper spacing |

#### CSS Classes Added
- `flex flex-col h-full`: Full-height flex container
- `overflow-auto flex-1`: Scrollable content area
- `sticky top-0`: Sticky table headers
- `max-w-[300px]`: Column width constraints
- `title={text}`: Tooltip attributes

### User Experience Benefits
- **Better Scrolling**: Tables in top sections now scroll independently without affecting layout
- **Improved Readability**: Constrained column widths prevent excessive horizontal stretching
- **Enhanced Usability**: Tooltips provide full text content when truncated
- **Consistent Spacing**: Proper spacing between all dashboard sections
- **Responsive Design**: All changes maintain dark mode and responsive behavior

### Updated Requirements (January 26, 2026)

**Feature Status**: ✅ **Core Implementation Complete** with 📋 **New Features to Implement**

The dashboard revamp is functionally complete for the original requirements. Two additional user experience enhancements have been identified and must be implemented:

#### 📋 New Features Required

1. **Real-time Selected Playlists Table Population**
   - Currently: Selected playlists only appear after export confirmation
   - Required: Selected playlists must immediately appear in Selected Playlists table when user selects them in main table
   - Impact: Improved user feedback and clearer understanding of selected items

2. **Songs Panel Display**
   - Currently: "Unmatched Songs" panel shows only unmatched tracks
   - Required: "Songs" panel shows all tracks as read-only display (no selection)
   - Impact: Better visibility of playlist contents without selection complexity

3. **Selected Playlists Table Track Selection**
   - Currently: Selected Playlists table only shows playlist information
   - Required: Add Select All checkbox + individual track checkboxes to Selected Playlists table
   - Impact: Granular control over which tracks to export from each selected playlist

4. **Remove Top Blue Progress Bar During Export** 📋 TO BE IMPLEMENTED
   - Currently: A blue progress bar appears at the top of the screen during export
   - Required: Remove this top-level progress bar component
   - Reason: Progress is already displayed per-playlist in the Selected Playlists table with individual progress bars
   - Impact: Cleaner UI, reduces visual clutter, maintains focus on per-playlist progress tracking
   - Technical: Remove or hide the top progress bar component from the export layout

#### Implementation Priority

- **High Priority**: These features significantly improve user experience
- **Backward Compatible**: Changes don't break existing functionality
- **User-Requested**: Based on actual user interaction feedback

### Conclusion

**Feature F3.2 Dashboard Revamp is CORE IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** with 📋 **Two additional features to implement**. The existing functionality meets all original requirements and is fully operational. The new features will enhance the user experience by providing real-time feedback and more granular export control.
